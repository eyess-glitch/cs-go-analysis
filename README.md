This repository contains the source code of a university project for "Data mining" course. The task of the projet, related to CS-GO, is to predict which team will win the round. The project includes the various phases of the CRISP-DM methodology, such as:

  1. Business Understanding  
  2. Data understanding
  3. Data preprocessing
  4. Modeling
  5. Model evaluation
  
Different models have been considered, some of which are:

  Decision trees
  naive bayes classifiers
  Random forest
  artificial neural networks
  SVM with SGD optimizer
  XGBoost
 
To each model was applied a phase of hyperparameter tuning.
